What this is:

A tool for dataflow tomography of tainted String data in Java applications (focusing on web applications).
Essentially it allows tagging interesting data in an application (such as what is read from databases), and 
tracking the complete flow of that data through the application.

Included are tools to visualize and analyze the data collection from the tracking, to suggest useful optimizations
for the application.
