Meeting August 13th

Still writing up evaluation section.
RUBiS evaluation is almost done
Working on figures and write up for jGossip

One thing I wanted to ask about was the style of the evaluation.

For RUBiS I basically start with an analysis, present some traces taken from the application, provide a breakdown for how to interpret the trace to show what kind of data is being traced. Then I show some graphs generated by the analyses, and break these down, describing how a developer could interpret these to make modifications to the application, highlighting the fact that the analysis was ultimately successful and found an instance of what it was looking for.

jGossip is going to proceed similarly, but the descriptions of the traces and analysis results will be more high level, as the graphs which come out of it are much more massive and can't really be broken down detail

I intend to have the evaluation section pretty much complete by end-of-week, Friday. And in the following week I can move onto chapter 1, 

which I think will move quicker than my evaluation writeup

and leave me with my first draft.

So it's looking like a first draft by the end of the month, with revisions to take place while I'm at Amazon.
