!!! Permissions
Permissions in JForum - also called ''Roles'' - are defined for [Groups], at Admin Panel -> Groups -> Permissions. The following table describes the permissions available in JForum. Every time you add a new [group|Groups] you must properly set its permissions. 

!! How permissions work
JForum uses a restrictive security model, which means that "If it is not there, then it is not accessible". This ensures more security, with the drawback of being a bit more complex to understand and configure the roles. 

Some considerations:

# Most roles are restrictive, which means that selecting a category or forum from the list will make the resource unavailable to the user or group being edited.
# Choosing "Allow All" will turn the resource available for all categories or forums. Exceptions to the case will be written in the permission box, when applicable.
