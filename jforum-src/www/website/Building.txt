!!! Building JForum
Basically, there are two ways to build JForum's source: using [Eclipse|http://www.eclipse.org], or running [Ant|http://ant.apache.org]. 

!! Using Eclipse
JForum is built using Eclipse as its primary IDE, so when you fetch the source code from the [CVS] the proper settings are already there. All you have to do is to import the project into the IDE. 

!! Using Ant
There is a ''build.xml'' script available for those who want to build JForum using [Ant|http://ant.apache.org]. It is located in the root directory, being the ''compile'' task the default one. Other available tasks are:

||Task name||Description
|''clean''|Cleans the api, build and dist directories
|''javadocs''|Generate the JavaDoc API
|''compile''|Compiles the source code into the build directory
|''dist''|Generates a ''war'' file of JForum
|''deploy''|Deploys JForum to the configured servlet container
