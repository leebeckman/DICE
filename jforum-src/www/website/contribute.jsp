	<div class="blue-title" style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Why supporting this project is a good thing</div>
	<div><img src="images/hr.gif" height="5" width="100%"></div>
	<p>
	The JForum Project started four years ago as a completely free and Open Source program, initially entirely developed on my (<a href="http://www.jforum.net/user/profile/3.page">Rafael Steil</a>) free time. Today, with the help of some very valuable people, I can spend more time on JForum, to improve it and implement new features (lots of things, requested either on the <a href="/community.jsp">forums</a> or registered in the <a href="/jira">bug tracker</a>).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	That's why I'm asking you to financially support this work. I love Open Source. I love to use good products without having to pay for it too. But when I see some program that is valuable to my work, that helps me making money, I think it is a good idea to support this project.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Reasons to support open projects</strong> 
			
		<ul class="ul-orange">	
			<li>Because Open Source is cool? Yes.</li> 
			<li>To thank for a great tool? Yes.</li> 
			<li>To help the project evolve because this will help my work and my earnings? Yes.</li> 
		</ul>
		<br>
		Also, as the project grows more and more, it would be great to, sometimes, reward some of the great people who help JForum.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So, that's what I'm asking you: if JForum helps your work, saves your time (time is money, remember?) and increase your earnings, support this project. The simpler way is to make any small donation via PayPal. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	JForum has grown a lot every day, since four years ago, which is a great thing, and initially it wasn't my intention to fully work on this tool. Lately, I'm spending a lot of time on it, specially to make JForum 3 a reality, to help users, to improve the program, to research about better solutions. So, your support is very welcome!
	</p>

	Thanks! Rafael Steil - JForum Project Leader.

	And, of course, a very very special thanks for people that support this project not with money, but with work. Testers, translators, forum visitors and people that wrote about it all over the Internet. Thanks!
