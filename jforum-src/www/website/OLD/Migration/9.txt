!!! PHPBB / PHPNuke to JForum migration
Migrating from a PHPBB or PHPNuke forum to JForum is quite straightforward. We provide a command line tool that reads all information from a source database - PHPBB or PHPNuke - and convert it to a JForum database. 

JForum's ''Phpbb2JForum'' is able to import ''most'' of the tables, as shown in the table below. Please note that, while there are items marked as __%%(color: red)no%%__, is doesn't  mean that JForum don't have a relative table - It only means that the table's data will not be imported by the tool. 

||Table Name||Is data Imported?||Description

!! Permissions / Access rights
''Phpbb2JForum'' __does not__ import permissions / roles, so, after the importing process is finished, you'll need to manually setup access rights for each for the imported groups. The migration tool only setup Admin access for those users who also are Administrators in the PHPBB version. 

!! Search - Indexing the database

!! Downloading the import tool
''Phpbb2JForum'' is a command line tool, which means you won't have a nice and fancy window :). Also, you'll need to have Java 1.4. It comes with the main JForum package, and it is located in the directory ''/tools/phpbb2jforum'', where you will find two files: phpbb2jforum.bat and phpbb2jforum.sh. The first is destined to be used in a Windows environment, while the second will work for any Unix based system - Linux, BSD, Mac OS X etc...

!! Preparing the environment
Now, you will need to have both JForum and PHPBB's tables under the same database name. In other words, ''Phpbb2JForum'' will search for phpbb's tables in the database's name passed as argument to the program ( as shown later in this doc ). So, if you're going to run JForum on a database named "jforum", all PBPBB tables should be located in this same database before the migration starts. You can achieve this by simple dumping ( using mysqldump, for example ) and restoring into the target database. 

The JForum's tables should be already created as well. The tables' structure are placed at ''WEB-INF/config/database/mysql/mysql_db_struct.sql''. 

!! Running

[{Note title='MySQL table type'

If you are using MySQL, set the table type to ''MyISAM'' instead of ''InnoDB'' before running the migration tool. This will make the SQL statements run much faster. 
After you finish with the data importing, you can set back to ''InnoDB''.
}]

Now, open the Prompt ( or a shell, if running some Unix like machine ) and go to the directory where the files are located. If you are running a Windows box, the program you'll run is named ''phpbb2jforum.bat''. If running Linux or other Unix like OS, the program is ''phpbb2jforum.sh'' ( please confirm if it has execute - "chmod +x" - permissions ). 

You should pass as arguments the database name, username, password and database host, as shown above:

[{Highlight
c:\jforum_migration\phpbb2jforum.bat jforum root rootPassword localhost 
}]

in this example, ''localhost'' is the host where the database server is, ''root'' is the username, ''rootPassword'' is the password for the ''root'' user, and ''jforum'' is the database name. Press &lt;ENTER&gt; to start. Wait until the program finishes, and then you're done. 

!! Permissions
The script __does not__ migrate permissions, so you'll have to do it manually. For the start, please access http://www.jforum.net/posts/list/399.page . In this link is shown how to set the administrator's role, which you can use as start to access the Admin Panel.
