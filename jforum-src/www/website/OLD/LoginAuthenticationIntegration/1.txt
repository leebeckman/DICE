!!! Integrating your application to JForum

By default JForum runs as a standalone web application, with its own user registration and login management.

Each option below provides a solution to integrate JForum into an application environment where existing user management and security policies are implemented.

!! Using Single Sign-On
You should use SSO if:
* your users already login to a website and you want JForum to be appear as part of that site.
* your users are authenticated for a 'user realm' which provides an implementation for the _request.getRemoteUser()_ method, e.g. tomcat security realm, JAAS etc.

!! Delegating the Authentication
If you have a centralised sign-on to facilitate the management of user credentials across multiple platforms and applications, you can configure JForum to delegate the authentication during the login process.

A good example of this would be an intranet where users credentials are stored on an LDAP server or Windows Active Directory.

!! Advanced Integration
You can incorporte many JForum features directly into your application, including sign-on and login management. Other examples include displaying most recent posts on your web-site's main pages and accessing users Private Messages.
