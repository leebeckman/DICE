!!! The JForum Team - People behind JForum

A project only evolves with feedback of users and contribution - be it programming, documenting, making graphics and so other many areas - of so many valuable people. Met some of the people who helped - or are still helping - JForum to grow.

People come and go all the time. Many times we receive help because an user needs some feature more quickly, or then he / she got some free time to contribute for a while, and is that kind of contribution which makes the project grow up. You are welcome to [join us|TeamJoin].
