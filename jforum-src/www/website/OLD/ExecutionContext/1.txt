!!! Integrating JForum
JForum uses [ThreadLocal|http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-threads3.html] for its execution contexts, which is where all the action occurs. In order to execute anything related to JForum, you have to setup the execution context, represented by the class ''net.jforum.JForumExecutionContext''. The most common used methods are ''get()'', ''set()'', ''setConnection()'', and ''setForumContext()'', this last being an instance of ''net.jforum.context.ForumContext'', usually ''net.jforum.context.JForumContext''. 

A ''ForumContext'' contains the HTTP Request and Response, as well the ''context path' and JForum's servlet extension. 

!! Creating a ''complete' execution context
By ''complete'' we mean an execution context that has a request, response and JDBC connection. Not every time you will need all this information - it depends of what you are trying to do -, but it is very likely that at least the HTTP request will be necessary.

import net.jforum.context.web.WebResponseContext;

// .....

try {
	// Retrieve an existing or create a new execution context
	JForumExecutionContext executionContext = JForumExecutionContext.get();
	
	// Create a ForumContext
	ForumContext forumContext = new JForumContext(request.getContextPath(), 
		".page", 
		new WebRequestContext(request), 
		new WebResponseContext(response));
	
	executionContext.setForumContext(forumContext);
	
	// If you have a valid JDBC connection at this point, you can 
	// set it as well
	executionContext.setConnection(connection);
	
	// Set back the new execution context, so we can use it
	JForumExecutionContext.set(executionContext);
	
	// ....
	// Execute all your JForum code here
	// ....
}
finally {
	// Release the resources
	JForumExecutionContext.finish();
}
