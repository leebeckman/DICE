!!! JForum 3 - Development process

!! Definining needs
TODO 

!! Unit testing
This one is simple: everything should be covered by unit tests. Yes, database code included. 
As JForum has a large set of functionalities that must work on different databases, unit testing is completely essential to ensure that changes made in some part of the code won't affect the rest of the system. 

So far, [JUnit 4|http://www.junit.org] is being used as unit testing framework without any problems. [TestNG|http://testng.org] is on the watch list, tough. 

!! Structure of unit tests
All tests are located at ''tests'' directory, usually following the main package structure with the ''TestCase'' postfixed to the class being tested. For example, the class ''net/jforum/dao/ForumDAO.java'' is covered by the tests located at ''test/core/net/jforum/dao/ForumDAOTestCase.java''. 

Please note that, when using [Eclipse|http://www.eclipse.org], the output directory for the test classes is ''tests/WEB-INF/classes'' instead of the default output directory, which is ''WEB-INF/classes''

!! What should be done first
There are a lot of things to do. Really. As a rule of thumb, the following order of steps is adopted for development:

# DAO (database code)
# Configuration handling
# Actions (now called ''Components'')
# Utility stuff
