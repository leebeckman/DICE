!! The template engine
JForum uses [Freemarker|http://freemarker.sf.net] as template engine. This means that you don't need to use any Java / JSP code to create the layouts for JForum. It is interesting to take a good look at the [freemarker manual|http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html] to learn more about it. In the following section you will find a brief overview of the most common used directives, which should be a good start for starters.
