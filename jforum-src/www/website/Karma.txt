!!! Karma
Karma is a note that users give each other, usually about the quality of the posts. It is represented in the forum by a set of ''stars'', which appear right together to each message and user's profile. 

Karma are an optional feature in JForum, and it may or may not be enabled in all boards. It is up to the Administrator to configure that, in the [Permissions] page.

!! Karma settings
Karma settings are defined in the main configuration file, ''SystemGlobals.properties'', or in the custom configuration file, ''jforum-custom.conf''. There are two possible keys, as described in the following table:

||Key name||Default value||Description
|karma.min.points|1|The minimum number of points that it is possible to give to a message
|karma.max.points|5|The maximum number of points that it is possible to give to a message

!! Enabling or disabling Karma
To enable or disable karma, go to the [Permissions] page, and refer to the section "Enable Karma". Set it to "true" to enable, and "false" to disable it to the respective group.
