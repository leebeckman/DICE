!!! Setting up the correct .SQL file for your MySQL database
If you're going to use [MySQL|http://www.mysql.com] as database, there are some pre-configurations you should do before starting up JForum. See the table below:

||MySQL Version||Action to do
|4.1.x or newer|*None*. The default ''mysql.sql'' file is already configured for the latest MySQL versions
|4.0.x|*Delete* the file ''WEB-INF/config/database/mysql.sql'' and __rename__ the file ''mysql_40.sql'' to ''mysql.sql''
|3.x|*Delete* the file ''WEB-INF/config/database/mysql.sql'' and __rename__ the file ''mysql_323.sql'' to ''mysql.sql''

That's all you have to do. JForum takes care of the rest.
