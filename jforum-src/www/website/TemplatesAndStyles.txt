!! The template engine
JForum uses [Freemarker|http://freemarker.sf.net] as template engine. This means that you don't need to use any Java / JSP code to create the layouts for JForum. It is interesting to take a good look at the [freemarker manual|http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html] to learn more about it. In the following section you will find a brief overview of the most common used directives, which should be a good start for starters. 

A Freemarker directive starts with ''<#'', and all variables are enclosed by ${}. Inside a directive, you don't use ${} - for example, to output a varialbe value, you write ''${variableName}'', but if you want to use ''variableName'' in an ''<#if>'' statement, you simply do '<#if variableName == "someValue">'. 

! Assign a variable
To create / change a variable in Freemarker, use the ''<#assign>'' directive:

[{Java2HtmlPlugin

<#assign name = "My name"/>
<#assign lastName = "Last name"/>
<#assign fullName = name + lastName/>
}]

! Conditionals
Conditionals in Freemarker are ''<#if>'', ''<#elseif>'' and ended by ''<#/if>''. You always have to end an ''<#if>'' statement with one ''</#if>'' statement. 

[{Java2HtmlPlugin

<#if someConditional>
    code code
<#elseif anotherConditional>
    code code code
<#else>
    more code
</#if>
}]

! Loops
You use the ''<#list>'' directive to iterate over any kind of collection - Lists or arrays. 

[{Java2HtmlPlugin

<#list collectionName as variableName>
    ${variableName.someProperty}
</#list>
}]

where ''collectionName'' is any kind of array of java.util.Collection, and ''variableName'' is the local variable you will use inside the block. 

! Calling properties and methods
To call any property or method, just use the dot notation.

[{Java2HtmlPlugin

${aObject.aProperty}
${aObject.someMethod()}
${aObject.anotherMethod("arg1", 2, "arg3", someFreemarkerVariable)}
<#assign result = someObject.myMethod()/>
}]
