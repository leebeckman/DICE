       nuggets could provide a natural site for electron and proton
       annihilation, providing 511 {keV} photons, gamma-rays, and
       diffuse {keV} X-ray radiation.  We show that identifying dark
       matter as antimatter nuggets is consistent with the observed
       emissions, and we make definite predictions about their
       spectrum and morphology.  If correct, our proposal not only
       identifies dark matter and explains baryogenesis, but allows
       X-ray observations to directly probe the matter
       distribution in our Galaxy.}

                 galaxy clusters have revealed a surprisingly large
                 amount of magnetic fields, whose estimated energy and
                 flux are, on average, {$\sim 10^{58}$} ergs and {$\sim
                 10^{41}$ G cm$^2$}, respectively. These quantities are
                 so much larger than any coherent sums of individual
                 galaxies within the cluster that an efficient galactic
                 dynamo is required. We associate these fields with
                 single AGNs within the cluster and therefore with all
                 galaxies during their AGN phase. Only the central,
                 massive black hole (BH) has the necessary binding
                 energy, {$\sim 10^{61}$} ergs. Only the accretion disk
                 during the {BH} formation has the winding number,
                 {$\sim 10^{11}$} turns, necessary to make the gain and
                 magnetic flux. We present a model of the BH accretion
                 disk dynamo that might create these magnetic fields,
                 where the helicity of the {$\alpha - \Omega$} dynamo is
                 driven by star-disk collisions. The back reaction of
                 the saturated dynamo forms a force-free field helix
                 that carries the energy and flux of the dynamo and
                 redistributes them within the clusters.",

                 the great clusters of galaxies are held together by the
                 gravitational force of unseen (dark) matter. Today, the
                 case is stronger and more precise: Dark, nonbaryonic
                 matter accounts for {$30\% \pm 7\%$} of the critical mass
                 density, with baryons (most of which are dark)
                 contributing only {$4.5\% \pm 0.5\%$} of the critical
                 density. The large-scale structure that exists in the
                 Universe indicates that the bulk of the nonbaryonic
                 dark matter must be cold (slowly moving particles). The
                 SuperKamiokande detection of neutrino oscillations
                 shows that particle dark matter exists, crossing an
                 important threshold. Over the past few years a case has
                 developed for a dark-energy problem. This dark
                 component contributes about {$80\% \pm 20\%$} of the critical
                 density and is characterized by very negative pressure
                 {$(p_X < -0.6 \rho_X)$}. Consistent with this picture of
                 dark energy and dark matter are measurements of {CMB}
                 anisotropy that indicate that total contribution of
                 matter and energy is within {$10\%$} of the critical
                 density. Fundamental physics beyond the standard model
                 is implicated in both the dark matter and dark energy
                 puzzles: new fundamental particles (e.g., axion or
                 neutralino) and new forms of relativistic energy (e.g.,
                 vacuum energy or a light scalar field). A flood of
                 observations will shed light on the dark side of the
                 Universe over the next two decades; as it does it will
                 advance our understanding of the Universe and the laws
                 of physics that govern it.",
