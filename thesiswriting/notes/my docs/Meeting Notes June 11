Current Status:

-Just finished writing the last analysis, currently testing it, which mainly involves modifying rubis a bit and making sure that the results are reasonable.
-All I need to do is test my caching analysis, and the access path refactoring analysis.

-The APR basically looks at the graph, and tries to pull data sources forward to simulate accessing them from different partitions, while seeing how that impacts interaction with other data sources. Both of these should be demo-ready by tonight.

Things to talk about:

    Schedule: About 2 weeks behind at this point. Sticking to my original schedule for writing, I basically have the rest of June to evaluate on real applications as I hoped to start writing pretty early in July. The original schedule did have a couple overflow weeks which I've already used, but more interestingly also made time for attempting to integrate my tool with Nima's.
        -Is integration with Nima actually necessary? Could just be a bunch of engineering headaches, since our models of applications may be fairly different. Could take longer than a week to get something meaningful out of this.
    
    Publishing Something: I could put together a paper based on what I've done, I'd have to think a bit about exactly what it would be, but maybe something about my experience doing dataflow tomography with AspectJ, or showing the use of my tool itself demonstrated by a simple application like RUBiS rather than the full applications which will form the base of my actual thesis.
    -Again this concerns my schedule.

    Next big phase of work: Evaluating with larger applications
    I've talked about JGossip and JForum up until now. My concern with these is mainly their use of JSP, and also big frameworks like struts.
        -Most of the server-side code may exist as JSP pages using big tag libraries. If my tool suggests a in the code generated from JSP pages, it's probably going to be way less useful to the developer, since they would never directly work with that code, and my tool is not going to be able to map back from Java to JSP tags.
        -It's possible that enough functionality in these applications does not rely on such frameworks that I can say something meaningful about them. I simply don't know yet, I'll need to start evaluating them a bit to see. It won't take long to say one way or the other, once I start looking at full traces.
        -So I may need to find a different application, something like RUBiS with few dependencies, only more complex.

    I can finish by August, right?
    
Note down: second reader

Workshop paper, suitable workshops?
    ICDCS? (focus on caching suggestion, improving web app performance with caching suggestions)
