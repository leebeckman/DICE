I have a second reader, Ed Knorr has agreed to do it.

-I'm working on large application evaluation, already missing RUBiS quite a bit.

Last week: got those analysis code bugs worked out on wednesday. Moved into working on large application evaluation on thursday/friday, and some of the weekend. Some of this was getting JForum to instrument properly, and then having some issues with jforum where it was timing out under instrumentation. I switched over to jgossip so I wouldn't have to deal with that.

-I need more time on evaluations before I have anything concrete to show.

The tool works really well on something small, like RUBiS. 
When big applications using huge java frameworks come into play, it's become a lot more challenging. 
The graphs that come out are MASSIVE. Thousands and thousands of nodes at present. 

What happened was I was looking at the big applications, then I moved to RUBiS to work on completing the tracker and writing the analysis code. At that point the tracker was able to trace more data, and now that I've come back to the big applications, I'm of course seeing a lot more data there.

I am currently working on dealing with that complexity. Seeing what I don't have to trace, to get down to the flows of data which actually matter. 
Basically I'm trying to make my evaluation manageable. 

I've been putting a lot of time into this, but I simply need more, though I'm not sure right now how much more.

Obviously my time is in short supply, and I know we've said that I really don't want to be doing any thesis work while I'm at Amazon, but I think I need to admit that that could be a reality. 

--- MEETING NOTES ---

-Confirm with office about second reader
-Run the analyses anyways, see what happens
