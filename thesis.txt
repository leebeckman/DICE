    Background
        Some problems in application migration
        Taint Tracking
        Dataflow Tomography
        Fluxo
        Application Partitioning

    Implementation
        The Tracker
        The Analysis Tool
            The analyses:
            Pre-Computation/Caching
            Post-Computation
            State Tracking
            Access Path Refactoring
            Wasteful Communication

    Evaluation
        Simple Example: RUBiS
        Real-World, Complex Example: JGossip

    Results
        Positive Results
        Challenges

    Discussion
        What works well
        Promising extensions to tool
        Need for a better taint tracker
        Control-tainting
        What didn't work so well
        Future work
