</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p> <b>3.1. Availability of Source Code.</b></p>
<p>Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise<br />
	    make available in Executable form must also be made<br />
	    available in Source Code form and that Source Code form<br />
	    must be distributed only under the terms of this License.<br />
	    You must include a copy of this License with every copy of<br />
	    the Source Code form of the Covered Software You<br />
	    distribute or otherwise make available.  You must inform<br />
	    recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form<br />
	    as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source<br />
	    Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium<br />
	    customarily used for software exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>3.2. Modifications.</b></p>
<p>The Modifications that You create or to which You<br />
	    contribute are governed by the terms of this License.  You<br />
	    represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your<br />
	    original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to<br />
	    grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>3.3. Required Notices.</b></p>
<p>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications<br />

	    Modification.  You may not remove or alter any copyright,<br />
	    patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered<br />
	    Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive<br />
	    text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial<br />
	    Developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</b></p>
<p>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered<br />
	    Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the<br />
	    applicable version of this License or the<br />
	    recipients rights hereunder.  You may choose to<br />
	    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br />
	    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more<br />
	    recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so<br />
	    only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br />
	    Developer or any Contributor.  You must make it absolutely<br />
	    clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or<br />
	    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You<br />
	    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br />
	    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial<br />
	    Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br />
	    support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b></p>
<p>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered<br />
	    Software under the terms of this License or under the<br />
	    terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms<br />
	    different from this License, provided that You are in<br />
	    compliance with the terms of this License and that the<br />
	    license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit<br />
	    or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code<br />
	    form from the rights set forth in this License.  If You<br />
	    distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a<br />
	    different license, You must make it absolutely clear that<br />
	    any terms which differ from this License are offered by<br />
	    You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.<br />
	    You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and<br />
	    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br />
	    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any<br />
	    such terms You offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>3.6. Larger Works.</b></p>
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered<br />
	    Software with other code not governed by the terms of this<br />
	    License and distribute the Larger Work as a single<br />
	    product.  In such a case, You must make sure the<br />
	    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered<br />
	    Software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>4. Versions of the License.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	      <b>4.1. New Versions.</b></p>
<p>Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward<br />
	    and may publish revised and/or new versions of this<br />
	    License from time to time.  Each version will be given a<br />
	    distinguishing version number.  Except as provided in<br />
	    Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the<br />
	    right to modify this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	      <b>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</b></p>
<p>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise<br />
	    make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br />
	    version of the License under which You originally received<br />
	    the Covered Software.  If the Initial Developer includes a<br />
	    notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being<br />
	    distributed or otherwise made available under any<br />
	    subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and<br />
	    make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br />
	    version of the License under which You originally received<br />
	    the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to<br />
	    use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software<br />
	    available under the terms of any subsequent version of the<br />
	    License published by the license steward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	    <b>4.3. Modified Versions.</b></p>
<p>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to<br />
	    create a new license for Your Original Software, You may<br />
	    create and use a modified version of this License if You:<br />
	    (a)&nbsp;rename the license and remove any references to<br />
	    the name of the license steward (except to note that the<br />
	    license differs from this License); and (b)&nbsp;otherwise<br />
	    make it clear that the license contains terms which differ<br />
	    from this License.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>	<b>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b></p>
<p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN<br />
	AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br />

	MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br />
	THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br />
	COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE<br />
	PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER<br />
	OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY<br />
	SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY<br />
	CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF ANY<br />
	COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS<br />
	DISCLAIMER.</p>

<p>
	<b>6. TERMINATION.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>6.1.</b> This License and the rights granted<br />
	  hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply<br />
	  with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30<br />
	  days of becoming aware of the breach.  Provisions which, by<br />
	  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination<br />
	  of this License shall survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>6.2.</b><br />
If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory<br />
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the<br />
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is<br />
referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software<br />
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor<br />
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial<br />
Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and<br />
all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant,<br />
the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)<br />
and all Contributors under Sections&nbsp;2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br />
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and<br />
automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if<br />
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the<br />
Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or<br />
pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>6.3.</b> In the event of termination under<br />
	  Sections&nbsp;6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses<br />
	  that have been<br />
	  validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to<br />
	  termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any<br />
	  distributor) shall survive termination.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	<b>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b></p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER<br />
	TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL<br />

	<b>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</b></p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning<br />
	subject matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is<br />

	only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.  This<br />
	License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction<br />
	specified in a notice contained within the Original Software<br />

	costs, including, without limitation, court costs and<br />
	reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.  The<br />

	law or regulation which provides that the language of a<br />
	contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not<br />
	apply to this License.  You agree that You alone are<br />
	responsible for compliance with the United States export<br />
